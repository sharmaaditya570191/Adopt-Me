### Adopt-Me

This is a single page pet adoption application primarily built to demonstrate several concepts of `React` with varying difficulty levels.

### Usage

**2.** Run `npm run dev` to start development server.  
You can also run `npm run dev:mock` to run the application offline. `npm run format` can be used to format the repository with `prettier`. Linting of code can be done using `npm run lint`.
